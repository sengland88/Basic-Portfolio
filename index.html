            <p>Shelby England is a long-time Floridian who hasn’t grown tired of the state’s tourist treasures — from his favorite hangout, Walt Disney World, to Florida’s picturesque, white sandy beaches. 
           He graduated from the University of Central Florida with a bachelor’s degree in interdiscplinary studies, which has led to a career in communication and a passion for creative writing.</p>

            <p>In his current role as Employee Communications Coordinator at Valencia College, he develops creative for various projects — including social media to video and graphic design.</p>

            <p>In his free time, when he isn’t taking in Florida’s gems, he’s spending time with family, writing superpower-inspired science fiction, hanging out with his dog, Dobby, or studying The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1. 
            (He’s still waiting for that letter from Hogwarts … pesky owls.).</p>
